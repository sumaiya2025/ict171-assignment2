  <h1>Photography Blog Project – ICT171 Assignment 1</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sumaiya Tabassum</p>
  <p><strong>Student ID:</strong> 35149407</p>

  <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
  <p>
    My cloud project is a photography blog website hosted on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform using DigitalOcean. The purpose of this project is to learn how to configure and manage a secure, cloud-based Linux server and use it to host a basic website. The site showcases a few sample photographs along with short descriptions. It represents both a technical deployment task and a personal creative space.
    <br><br>
    For this project, I deployed an Ubuntu droplet on DigitalOcean and installed the Nginx web server to serve my site content. I also purchased a domain name — sumaiya.website — from Web.com, and pointed its DNS records to my server's IP. To make the site secure and accessible, I installed a free SSL certificate from Let’s Encrypt, enabling HTTPS.
    <br><br>
    The website is built using static HTML and CSS. It includes sample photos and an overview of the blog concept, fulfilling the minimum content requirements. No backend or database was used, as the purpose was to focus on deploying infrastructure manually and understanding how each component works.
    <br><br>
    Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in managing Linux via SSH, configuring Nginx, securing a site with SSL, managing DNS records, and hosting a website independently. In future, I may expand the blog to include categories such as nature, architecture, or portraits. This project demonstrates my foundational understanding of server environments and cloud infrastructure, which are key outcomes of this unit.

  <h2>License Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    I selected the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license for this project. This license allows others to view, share, and adapt the photos and content on my blog, as long as they credit me and do not use the material for commercial purposes. I chose this to protect my photography from misuse while supporting open learning and sharing online.
